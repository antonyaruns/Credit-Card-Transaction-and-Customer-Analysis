## Project Overview:

The project comprises two main components

## Credit Card Transaction Analysis:

QTR Revenue and Transaction Count:
- Analyze quarterly revenue trends and transaction counts to understand seasonal variations in credit card usage.
- Identify peak quarters or months for revenue generation and transaction activity.

Revenue by Expenditure Type:
- Break down revenue by expenditure types such as retail, dining, travel, and entertainment.
- Identify which expenditure types contribute most to overall revenue and transaction volume.

Revenue by Education:
- Analyze revenue distribution among customers based on their educational backgrounds.
- Determine whether there are any correlations between education level and spending behavior.

Revenue by Customer Job:
- Investigate revenue generated by customers across different job roles or industries.
- Identify high-value customer segments based on their professions or occupations.

Customer Acquisition Cost:
- Calculate the cost of acquiring new customers and analyze its impact on revenue.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing and acquisition strategies in generating revenue.

Revenue by Chip Usage:
- Analyze revenue generated from transactions using chip-enabled credit cards versus traditional swipe transactions.
- Identify trends in chip usage and its impact on revenue generation.

## Credit Card Customer Analysis:

Revenue vs Gender:
- Compare revenue generated by male and female customers to understand gender-based spending patterns.
- Identify any disparities in spending behavior between genders.

Age Group Analysis:
- Segment customers into age groups and analyze revenue distribution among different age brackets.
- Identify age groups that contribute the most revenue and their spending preferences.

Top 5 States:
- Identify the top five states with the highest revenue contribution from credit card transactions.
- Analyze regional spending patterns and preferences among customers.

Salary Group Analysis:
- Segment customers based on salary ranges and analyze revenue generated from each group.
- Determine whether there are correlations between income levels and spending behavior.

Dependent Count Analysis:
- Analyze revenue distribution based on the number of dependents each customer has.
- Determine whether there are any correlations between family size and spending habits.

Marital Status Analysis:
- Investigate revenue distribution among customers based on their marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced).
- Identify any differences in spending behavior based on marital status.

Education Level Analysis:
- Segment customers based on their educational backgrounds and analyze revenue distribution.
- Determine whether there are any correlations between education level and spending behavior.

By conducting detailed analyses of transaction data and customer demographics, the project aims to provide actionable insights into credit card usage patterns, customer preferences, and factors influencing revenue generation. These insights can inform strategic decision-making and targeted marketing efforts to optimize business outcomes in the credit card industry.
